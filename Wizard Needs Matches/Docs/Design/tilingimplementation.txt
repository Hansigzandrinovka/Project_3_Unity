on tile start, tile connects itself to nearby tiles only if L/R/U/D tile not defined, stores the entity on top of it
dungeon manager has a count of existing tiles in dungeon, possibly 

Tile tag for every sprite with a Tile script
Dungeon Manager handles time, not tiles
Dungeon Manager can create tiles at specific positions, tiles handle their connecting automatically
Create special Layer Mask that only collides with Tiles
Exit Tile inherits from Tile class maybe

any Entity, when it attempts to move, will Move(direction) which will call its Tile's getTile(direction).IsWalkable(this), and if true, will move to that spot
