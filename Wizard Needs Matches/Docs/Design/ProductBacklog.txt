Gem Matching Roguelike Game:

Priority Features (1st Sprint):
Swap two clicked gems (click one, then an adjacent one, and they swap positions)
Replace removed gems (when a match is made, gems fall from the top to replace it)
Match 3, 4, or 5 gems (after a swap, try to match around the two gems, after a reset, try to match all gems)
Increase energy on match (as the gems click together in his head, person finds the energy to take another step)
Character shows up on screen (the person stands in the middle of the dungeon)
Character walking with WASD (person can walk around, but not into things)
Character attacks by walking into enemies (person does X damage to the zombie he ran into)
Character casts spells in direction they face with #num keys (person casts fireball upwards, it hits zombie for Y damage)
Character turns to the left and right with QE (person turns to face Goblin before casting fireball)
Monsters walk towards player, turn to face (Orc walks around the wall and stares person straight in the eyes)
Monsters attack player (Orc swings its greatsword at the player, dealing more damage because it is facing person)
Monsters can be attacked (person is angry at being greatsword-ed, and stabs its dagger at Orc)
Basic Dungeon floor (you see before you a vast assortment of boring ordinary grey tiles)
obstacles player/monsters can't move through (person stubs their toe on a wall, then walks around the corner)
Map creation (what person doesn't know is that each of the tiles of the dungeon is connected to the tiles around it,
which connect around them, and around them, and around them, and...)

Important Features:

Possible Walls
Possible sounds
possible procedural generation (this dungeon seems different than the last one I played)
possible additional effects for matching (the four earth gems explode, releasing an earthquake around person)
complex dungeon floors (rooms with cool stuff in them connected by hallways)
music changes based on the ratio of player health to monster health (this floor seems tough, just listen to the music)
fast and slow monsters (Golems move every two steps, but Rats move twice every step)
multiple spells (person casts Earthbolt, Firebolt, Icebolt, Airblast, Earthquake, Iceshield, Tornado, etc.)
Art assets (so our characters aren't all color-filled circles and squares)
keybinding inputs ("what idiot thought 'T' key was good for casting spell 7? I'll rebind it to 'P'")

Additional Features:

Swap by mouse-dragging from one gem to another
damage types (X monster is resistant to Y damage type, taking less damage, but is weak to Z damage type, taking more damage)
Haste and Slow Spells (the Orc's movement slows, giving person plenty of time to poke him before stepping away)
player dances when idle (easter egg, or feature?)
multiplayer (player 1 steps forward, player 2 matches a few gems, then cast Fireball, then the monsters act
gems buff spells (matching 3 red gems, person unleashes a bigger Fireball than before)
matching board gets bigger each level (first its 8x8, then 9x9, then 10x10, etc.)
monsters get tougher every floor (could be double health, or some smaller amount)
player gear (player loots Armored Vest from chest, increasing defense by 2)
save and load the game
high scores

Unresolved Issues:
does player movement cost energy?
