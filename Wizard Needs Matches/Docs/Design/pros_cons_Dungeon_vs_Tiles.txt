Tile objects know their bordering Tile objects
	2d array contains criteria of each tile
		possible
 - link Tiles when created
 - Tile creation through interface is difficult
 - Tile procedural creation somewhat difficult
 - good for pathfinding algorithms
 - entities know what is around them through their tile
 - easier to design non-square dungeons
 - less memory intensive for really big dungeons

vs


Dungeon has an array of Tile objects
 - all tile fetches are done through indexes in array
 - all entities know the entire dungeon layout
 - we are already doing array implementation for gem game
	- but tiles are static, gems are dynamic
 - better for non-procedural generation
 - easier to implement
