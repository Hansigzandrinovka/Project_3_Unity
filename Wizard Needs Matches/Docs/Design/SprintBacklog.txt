Gem Matching Roguelike Game: Priority Features

Priority Features (1st Sprint):
Swap two clicked gems (click one, then an adjacent one, and they swap positions)
Replace removed gems (when a match is made, gems fall from the top to replace it)
Match 3, 4, or 5 gems (after a swap, try to match around the two gems, after a reset, try to match all gems)
Increase energy on match (as the gems click together in his head, person finds the energy to take another step)
Character shows up on screen (the person stands in the middle of the dungeon)
Character walking with WASD (person can walk around, but not into things)
Character attacks by walking into enemies (person does X damage to the zombie he ran into)
Character casts spells in direction they face with #num keys (person casts fireball upwards, it hits zombie for Y damage)
Character turns to the left and right with QE (person turns to face Goblin before casting fireball)
Monsters walk towards player, turn to face (Orc walks around the wall and stares person straight in the eyes)
Monsters attack player (Orc swings its greatsword at the player, dealing more damage because it is facing person)
Monsters can be attacked (person is angry at being greatsword-ed, and stabs its dagger at Orc)
Basic Dungeon floor (you see before you a vast assortment of boring ordinary grey tiles)
obstacles player/monsters can't move through (person stubs their toe on a wall, then walks around the corner)
Map creation (what person doesn't know is that each of the tiles of the dungeon is connected to the tiles around it,
which connect around them, and around them, and around them, and...)
